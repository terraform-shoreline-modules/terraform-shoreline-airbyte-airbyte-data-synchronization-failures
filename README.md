### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Airbyte Data Synchronization Failures.

This incident type refers to any issues related to the synchronization of data in Airbyte, which is a data integration platform used to move data from various sources to different destinations. The failure could be due to a variety of reasons, such as network connectivity issues, misconfigured settings, or data compatibility issues. When this incident occurs, data may not be transferred correctly, leading to data discrepancies and potential data loss. It is crucial to resolve this issue as soon as possible to ensure that data is correctly synchronized and up-to-date.

### Parameters

```shell
export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"
export AIRBYTE_POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export DEPLOYMENT_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if the Airbyte pod is running

```shell
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} -l app.kubernetes.io/component=airbyte
```

### Check the logs of the Airbyte pod

```shell
kubectl logs -n ${NAMESPACE} ${AIRBYTE_POD_NAME}
```

### Check if the Airbyte pod has the correct environment variables set

```shell
kubectl exec -n ${NAMESPACE} ${AIRBYTE_POD_NAME} -- env | grep AIRBYTE_
```

### Check the configuration of the Airbyte pod

```shell
kubectl describe pod -n ${NAMESPACE} ${AIRBYTE_POD_NAME}
```

### Check the resource consumption of the Airbyte pod

```shell
kubectl top pod -n ${NAMESPACE} ${AIRBYTE_POD_NAME}
```

## Repair

### Restart the data synchronization process to ensure that it is running correctly and that any errors have been resolved.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Set the namespace and deployment name for Airbyte
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}

# Restart the deployment to restart the data synchronization process
kubectl rollout restart deployment $DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE

# Verify that the deployment has restarted successfully
kubectl rollout status deployment $DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
```

### If necessary, roll back to a previous version of the data synchronization process to restore any lost data and prevent further data loss.

```shell
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the deployment and namespace
DEPLOYMENT=${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}

# Get the current deployment revision
CURRENT_REVISION=$(kubectl rollout history deployment $DEPLOYMENT -n $NAMESPACE | grep -o '[0-9]*' | tail -1)

# Get the previous deployment revision
PREVIOUS_REVISION=$((CURRENT_REVISION - 1))

# Rollback to the previous deployment revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment $DEPLOYMENT -n $NAMESPACE --to-revision=$PREVIOUS_REVISION
```
